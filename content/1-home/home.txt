Text: Co-creation starts from the idea that everyone is an expert on one issue or another, first and foremost on their own life. Co-creation can enrich the stories a museum tells and change the way a museum programs its events. This website was made especially for heritage professionals and hopes to inspire you with good practices and concrete tools to start thinking about co-creation in an informed and concrete way. Enjoy the site and please leave your thoughts and ideas in the comments sections!
